# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Low-Level Feature Extraction API

## **Overview**
The Low-Level Feature Extraction API is a backend service designed to analyze design images and extract key visual elements. It focuses on precision and efficiency, providing structured data for further analysis or integration into design evaluation workflows.

---

## **Goals**
1. Extract low-level design features such as colors, fonts, shapes, shadows, and text from images.
2. Provide a lightweight and efficient API for developers and designers.
3. Ensure the extracted features are accurate and structured for easy integration.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Color Palette Extraction**:
   - Identify primary, background, and accent colors.
   - Return RGB and HEX values.

2. **Font Detection**:
   - Extract font family, size, and weight.
   - Use OCR for text recognition.

3. **Shape Analysis**:
   - Detect shapes and measure border radii.
   - Analyze curvature and edge properties.

4. **Shadow Analysis**:
   - Detect shadow intensity, spread, and direction.
   - Measure opacity and gradient.

5. **Text Recognition**:
   - Extract visible text from images.
   - Post-process text for noise removal.

## **API Endpoints**
1. **/extract-colors**
   - **Description**: Extracts the primary, background, and accent colors from an image.
   - **Input**: Image file (PNG, JPEG, etc.).
   - **Output**:
     ```json
     {
       "primary": "#007BFF",
       "background": "#F0F0F0",
       "accent": ["#FF6F61", "#FFD700"]
     }
     ```

2. **/extract-fonts**
   - **Description**: Detects and identifies fonts used in the design.
   - **Input**: Image file.
   - **Output**:
     ```json
     {
       "family": "Roboto",
       "size": "16px",
       "weight": "400"
     }
     ```

3. **/extract-shapes**
   - **Description**: Analyzes shapes, border radii, and curvature.
   - **Input**: Image file.
   - **Output**:
     ```json
     {
       "borderRadius": "8px"
     }
     ```

4. **/extract-shadows**
   - **Description**: Detects shadow intensity, spread, and direction.
   - **Input**: Image file.
   - **Output**:
     ```json
     {
       "intensity": "subtle",
       "spread": "4px",
       "direction": "bottom-right"
     }
     ```

5. **/extract-text**
   - **Description**: Extracts visible text from the image.
   - **Input**: Image file.
   - **Output**:
     ```json
     {
       "text": ["Welcome to the app", "Sign In", "Create Account"]
     }
     ```

## **Technical Requirements**
1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Framework**: FastAPI
3. **Libraries**:
   - OpenCV: For image processing and shape analysis.
   - Pillow (PIL): For basic image manipulation and color extraction.
   - Scikit-Image: For advanced color analysis.
   - Tesseract OCR: For text recognition.
4. **Server**: Uvicorn for running the FastAPI application.
5. **Input Formats**: PNG, JPEG, BMP.
6. **Output Format**: JSON.

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Performance**:
   - API response time should be under 1 second for standard images (<5MB).
2. **Scalability**:
   - Support concurrent requests for multiple image analyses.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Return meaningful error messages for invalid inputs or processing failures.
4. **Security**:
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent malicious uploads.

---

## **Milestones**
1. **Week 1**: Set up the FastAPI framework and basic server.
2. **Week 2**: Implement color extraction and text recognition endpoints.
3. **Week 3**: Add shape and shadow analysis endpoints.
4. **Week 4**: Finalize font detection and integrate all endpoints.
5. **Week 5**: Test, optimize, and deploy the API.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
1. Add support for SVG and PDF input formats.
2. Integrate machine learning models for advanced font detection.
3. Provide visual annotations for extracted features (e.g., highlight detected colors or shapes).
