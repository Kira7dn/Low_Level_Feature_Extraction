# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the API for performance, implement caching, and prepare for deployment with Docker and configuration for scalability.
# Details:
1. Create a caching utility in `/app/utils/cache.py`:
```python
from functools import wraps
import hashlib
import json
import time
from typing import Dict, Any, Callable

# Simple in-memory cache
class SimpleCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size=100, ttl=300):
        """Initialize cache with max size and time-to-live (seconds)"""
        self.cache: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.ttl = ttl
    
    def get(self, key: str) -> Any:
        """Get item from cache if it exists and is not expired"""
        if key not in self.cache:
            return None
        
        item = self.cache[key]
        if time.time() > item["expires"]:
            # Remove expired item
            del self.cache[key]
            return None
        
        return item["value"]
    
    def set(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:
        """Add item to cache with expiration"""
        # If cache is full, remove oldest item
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            oldest_key = min(self.cache.keys(), key=lambda k: self.cache[k]["expires"])
            del self.cache[oldest_key]
        
        self.cache[key] = {
            "value": value,
            "expires": time.time() + self.ttl
        }
    
    def clear(self) -> None:
        """Clear all cache items"""
        self.cache.clear()

# Create global cache instance
cache = SimpleCache()

def cache_result(ttl=300):
    """Decorator to cache function results"""
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Create a cache key from function name and arguments
            key_parts = [func.__name__]
            # Add args and kwargs to key
            for arg in args:
                if hasattr(arg, "read"):
                    # For file-like objects, hash the content
                    pos = arg.tell()
                    content = await arg.read()
                    await arg.seek(pos)
                    key_parts.append(hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest())
                else:
                    key_parts.append(str(arg))
            
            for k, v in sorted(kwargs.items()):
                key_parts.append(f"{k}:{v}")
            
            cache_key = hashlib.md5(json.dumps(key_parts).encode()).hexdigest()
            
            # Check cache
            result = cache.get(cache_key)
            if result is not None:
                return result
            
            # Execute function if not in cache
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            
            # Cache result
            cache.set(cache_key, result)
            
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

2. Apply caching to the API endpoints (example for colors.py):
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, UploadFile, File, HTTPException, status
from ..services.image_processor import ImageProcessor
from ..services.color_extractor import ColorExtractor
from ..utils.image_validator import validate_image
from ..utils.error_handler import APIError
from ..utils.cache import cache_result
from typing import Dict, List

router = APIRouter()

@router.post(
    "/extract-colors",
    response_model=Dict[str, object],
    status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK,
    summary="Extract color palette",
    response_description="Color palette with primary, background, and accent colors"
)
@cache_result(ttl=600)  # Cache results for 10 minutes
async def extract_colors(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    """Extract the primary, background, and accent colors from an image."""
    try:
        # Validate and load image
        image_bytes = await validate_image(file)
        cv_image = ImageProcessor.load_cv2_image(image_bytes)
        
        # Extract color palette
        palette = ColorExtractor.analyze_palette(cv_image)
        
        return palette
    except APIError as e:
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        raise APIError(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail=f"Error extracting colors: {str(e)}",
            code="color_extraction_error"
        )
```

3. Create a Dockerfile for containerization:
```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.9 slim image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies for OpenCV and Tesseract
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    libglib2.0-0 \
    tesseract-ocr \
    libtesseract-dev \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY ./app ./app
COPY ./static ./static

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
ENV PORT=8000

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

4. Create a docker-compose.yml file for local development:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app/app
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
      - MAX_WORKERS=4
    restart: unless-stopped
```

5. Create a performance optimization module in `/app/utils/optimizer.py`:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import io

class ImageOptimizer:
    @staticmethod
    def resize_if_needed(image, max_dimension=1200):
        """Resize image if it's too large while maintaining aspect ratio"""
        height, width = image.shape[:2]
        
        # If image is already small enough, return as is
        if max(height, width) <= max_dimension:
            return image
        
        # Calculate new dimensions
        if width > height:
            new_width = max_dimension
            new_height = int(height * (max_dimension / width))
        else:
            new_height = max_dimension
            new_width = int(width * (max_dimension / height))
        
        # Resize image
        resized = cv2.resize(image, (new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
        
        return resized
    
    @staticmethod
    def optimize_for_processing(image_bytes):
        """Optimize image for processing to improve performance"""
        # Load image
        nparr = np.frombuffer(image_bytes, np.uint8)
        image = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
        
        # Resize if needed
        optimized = ImageOptimizer.resize_if_needed(image)
        
        return optimized
```

6. Update the image processor to use the optimizer:
```python
from PIL import Image
import io
import numpy as np
import cv2
from ..utils.optimizer import ImageOptimizer

class ImageProcessor:
    @staticmethod
    def load_image(image_bytes):
        """Load image from bytes into PIL Image"""
        return Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
    
    @staticmethod
    def load_cv2_image(image_bytes):
        """Load image from bytes into OpenCV format with optimization"""
        return ImageOptimizer.optimize_for_processing(image_bytes)
```

7. Create a configuration module in `/app/config.py`:
```python
import os
from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Application settings"""
    # API settings
    API_TITLE: str = "Low-Level Feature Extraction API"
    API_VERSION: str = "1.0.0"
    DEBUG: bool = os.getenv("DEBUG", "0") == "1"
    
    # Server settings
    HOST: str = "0.0.0.0"
    PORT: int = int(os.getenv("PORT", "8000"))
    WORKERS: int = int(os.getenv("MAX_WORKERS", "4"))
    
    # Image processing settings
    MAX_FILE_SIZE: int = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
    MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION: int = 4000
    OPTIMIZATION_DIMENSION: int = 1200
    
    # Cache settings
    CACHE_TTL: int = 600  # 10 minutes
    CACHE_MAX_SIZE: int = 100
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

# Create global settings instance
settings = Settings()
```

8. Update main.py to use the configuration:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.openapi.docs import get_swagger_ui_html
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException

    debug=settings.DEBUG
)

# Mount static files
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")

@app.get("/docs", include_in_schema=False)
async def custom_swagger_ui_html():
    return get_swagger_ui_html(

        title=app.title + " - API Documentation",
        oauth2_redirect_url=app.swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url,
        swagger_js_url="/static/swagger-ui-bundle.js",
        swagger_css_url="/static/swagger-ui.css",
    )

app.include_router(shadows.router, prefix="/api/v1", tags=["shadows"])
app.include_router(fonts.router, prefix="/api/v1", tags=["fonts"])

@app.get("/", tags=["general"])
async def root():
    """Root endpoint returning API information"""
    return {
        "message": "Welcome to the Low-Level Feature Extraction API",
        "version": settings.API_VERSION,
        "documentation": "/docs"
    }

@app.get("/health", tags=["general"])
async def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint for monitoring"""
    return {"status": "healthy"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(
        "app.main:app", 
        host=settings.HOST, 
        port=settings.PORT,
        workers=settings.WORKERS,
        reload=settings.DEBUG
    )
```

# Test Strategy:

2. Test caching effectiveness by measuring response times for repeated requests
3. Test with various image sizes to verify resizing optimization
4. Load test the API to ensure it can handle concurrent requests
5. Test Docker deployment in a local environment
6. Verify that environment variables correctly override default settings
7. Test memory usage under load to ensure there are no memory leaks
8. Verify that the health check endpoint correctly reports system status
9. Test API performance with and without caching enabled
10. Verify that the Docker container starts correctly and the API is accessible

Evaluate and implement appropriate caching mechanisms (Redis, Memcached, or in-memory), identify cacheable content, implement cache invalidation strategies, and measure performance improvements.

Implementation progress:
- Created a cache_result decorator with 1-hour TTL (time-to-live)
- Applied caching to color extraction endpoints in colors.py
- This optimization improves performance for repeated color extraction requests by avoiding redundant processing
- The 1-hour TTL provides a good balance between performance and data freshness
- Next steps: Extend caching to other computationally expensive operations and implement cache invalidation for data updates

<info added on 2025-05-14T13:57:14.970Z>
Implemented a new comprehensive `auto_process_image()` method in the image processing pipeline that serves as a one-stop solution for image optimization:

- Created a unified method that combines multiple optimization techniques:
  - Handles various input image types automatically (bytes, PIL, OpenCV)
  - Performs intelligent image resizing with configurable max dimensions (default: 1920x1080)
  - Converts images to target format with WebP as default
  - Supports quality configuration (default: 85%)
  - Includes integrated performance logging

- Implementation details:
  - Added input type detection to process any image format seamlessly
  - Implemented sequential processing pipeline: load → resize → convert → compress
  - Added parameter validation with sensible defaults
  - Integrated with existing performance monitoring system
  - Added comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages

- Benefits:
  - Significantly simplifies client code by providing a single method call
  - Ensures consistent image optimization across the application
  - Reduces the likelihood of errors through standardized processing
  - Maintains flexibility through configurable parameters
  - Improves developer experience with intuitive API

- Usage example:
  ```python
  # Simple usage with defaults
  optimized_image = image_processor.auto_process_image(input_image)
  
  # Advanced usage with custom parameters
  optimized_image = image_processor.auto_process_image(
      input_image,
      max_width=800,
      max_height=600,
      target_format='AVIF',
      quality=90
  )
  ```

This new method complements the existing specialized methods while providing a simplified interface for common image optimization needs. The implementation follows the established patterns in the codebase and maintains compatibility with the existing performance monitoring system.

Added comprehensive test suite for `auto_process_image()`:
- Created two test cases to validate the method's functionality
  1. `test_auto_process_image_pil()`: Tests processing of PIL images
  2. `test_auto_process_image_cv2()`: Tests processing of OpenCV images

Test Coverage:
- Verifies method works with different input image types
- Checks image resizing to specified max dimensions
- Validates format conversion to WebP
- Ensures consistent output as bytes
- Tests with large images to validate resizing logic

Key Validation Points:
- Input image converted to bytes
