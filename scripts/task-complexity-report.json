      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization and deployment task into subtasks covering: (1) API performance benchmarking, (2) caching utility implementation and integration, (3) image processing pipeline optimization, (4) Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup, (5) configuration management for scalability, and (6) deployment validation and monitoring.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple advanced concerns: optimizing API performance, implementing and integrating caching, refactoring the image processing pipeline, containerizing the application with Docker, managing configuration for scalability, and validating deployment. Each area requires specialized knowledge and careful coordination, especially given the dependencies on all prior backend tasks and the need for robust testing and monitoring. The breadth and depth of required changes, as well as the need for cross-cutting integration, make this a high-complexity task that benefits from at least six focused subtasks."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the unified image analysis frontend task into subtasks for: (1) image upload component, (2) API integration layer, (3) analysis options interface, (4) results visualization components, (5) workflow integration and state management, (6) comprehensive test infrastructure, (7) feature extraction options UI, and (8) unified response handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing and building a complex, user-facing frontend with advanced features: file upload, configurable analysis options, interactive result visualizations, robust state management, and comprehensive testing. The need for accessibility, performance, extensibility, and integration with a sophisticated backend API further increases complexity. The task is best managed by dividing it into at least eight subtasks, each addressing a major architectural or functional area."
