      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the shadow analysis endpoint implementation into subtasks covering image preprocessing, shadow region detection, intensity calculation, spread measurement, direction analysis, endpoint integration, error handling, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves advanced image processing (multiple algorithms for shadow detection, intensity, spread, and direction), integration with FastAPI, and robust testing. The logic is non-trivial, requiring careful handling of edge cases and performance. The presence of several interdependent subtasks and the need for both algorithmic and API-level work increases complexity[3][4][5]."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Font Detection Endpoint",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the font detection endpoint into subtasks for image preprocessing, text region detection, font size estimation, font weight estimation, font family identification, endpoint integration, and end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "Font detection from images requires multiple steps: preprocessing, text region segmentation, and heuristic or ML-based font property extraction. While the provided logic is modular, accurate font family detection is challenging and may require further refinement. The endpoint also needs robust error handling and testing, making this a moderately high-complexity task[3][4][5]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose error handling and input validation into subtasks for custom error handler implementation, integration with FastAPI, comprehensive image validation, updating routers to use new error handling, testing for all error scenarios, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily architectural and cross-cutting, requiring updates to multiple modules and ensuring consistency. While not algorithmically complex, it demands thoroughness and careful integration, especially to cover all error cases and maintain a robust API[1][2][4]."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide API documentation and testing into subtasks for enhancing OpenAPI docs, documenting each endpoint, setting up automated test infrastructure, writing unit/integration tests for each endpoint, and verifying documentation accuracy.",
      "reasoning": "This task is process-oriented, involving documentation and test setup. While it spans the entire API, the work is well-structured and leverages FastAPI's built-in features, making it less complex than algorithmic tasks but still requiring attention to detail[1][2]."

      "reasoning": "This task covers both backend optimization (caching, image resizing) and DevOps (Docker, deployment, configuration). It requires knowledge of performance tuning, containerization, and scalable deployment, making it moderately complex and multi-disciplinary[4][5]."
